# Explaination

This doesn't make sense after all, but whatever...

After I watched his newest videos, I kinda wanted to make additional effects for this thing, so I found random tutorials on YouTube but it's not really helpful that much as they doing some weird shits that doesn't make sense, beside that, I also finding  on GitHub repo and I found a good one and start making it, it's been 3-4 hours I was working on in 2 days and then I stopped immediately because I didn't see any of links for a source code itself for Datastream, but next day, I try something different and i have another solution to get this work, so, I create this code, including VBS scripts for replacing final message instead of Command Prompt, after I got lucky this already working to build, I send to Von for a executable file but unfortunately the browser itself even Windows Defender got detected as virus, because I NEVER put any of malicious code and I don't thing is going wrong with it, after for a while to configure it myself, he decided to send some assets and others to me to make my owns.
